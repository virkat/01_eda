    "# The Life Cycle of Data\n",
    "The life cycle of data refers to the various stages that data undergoes, from its initial generation or acquisition to its eventual disposal or archival. These stages help ensure that data is properly managed, secure, and utilized efficiently. The key stages in the data life cycle are as follows:\n",
    "1. **Data Creation/Acquisition**\n",
    "    - **Description**: This is the stage where data is created or collected. It could be generated internally (e.g., through sensors, business processes) or acquired from external sources (e.g., through APIs, third-party vendors, or user input).\n",
    "    - **Key Activities**: Data generation, collection, and ingestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Storage**\n",
    "    - **Description**: Once data is created or acquired, it needs to be stored securely. This involves selecting appropriate storage solutions, which could range from databases and data lakes to cloud storage.\n",
    "    - **Key Activities**: Structuring data, ensuring secure storage, applying redundancy/backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Processing**\n",
    "    - **Description**: In this stage, data is processed and transformed into usable forms. This includes data cleaning, transforming raw data into structured formats, and possibly performing calculations or analytics.\n",
    "    - **Key Activities:** Data transformation, enrichment, cleaning, aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Analysis**\n",
    "    -   **Description**: After processing, data is analyzed to extract insights or information. Various analytical techniques, including descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, may be applied.\n",
    "    - **Key Activities**: Running queries, data visualization, applying statistical or machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Usage**\n",
    "    - **Description**: The insights derived from data analysis are applied in decision-making processes, business operations, or presented to end users. Data is used in applications, reports, dashboards, or shared with stakeholders.\n",
    "    - **Key Activities**: Reporting, decision-making, providing actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Sharing**\n",
    "    - **Description**: Data or its analysis results may need to be shared internally within an organization or externally with partners, customers, or other stakeholders. This can involve APIs, data exports, or report distribution.\n",
    "    - **Key Activities**: Data distribution, collaboration, setting access permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Data Archiving**\n",
