    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Each type of analytics—descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive—serves a unique purpose and fits into the overall data strategy. Descriptive analytics focuses on understanding the past, diagnostic analytics explains why things happened, predictive analytics anticipates future events, and prescriptive analytics helps decide what actions to take. Together, these types of analytics allow businesses to make informed, data-driven decisions that can improve efficiency, reduce risks, and capitalize on opportunities."
